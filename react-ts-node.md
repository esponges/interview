This is a set of questions and answers about React, TypeScript, and Node.js. It is a work in progress.

## Table of Contents
### React
* Basic
- What's the difference between a class component and a functional component? Which one should I use?
- What are the main lifecycle methods in React? What are they used for? If you have knowledge both in class and functional components how would you compare them?
- What is the difference between state and props?
- What's a global store? What's the difference between it and a state? When you should use each one?
- How would can you updated a value without re-rendering the component? (Hint: use `useRef` hook)
- What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
- What's the DOM?
- How does the DOM differ from the Virtual DOM?
- Why React? Do you know other frameworks? How would you compare them?
- What is JSX? How it differs from markup languages like HTML?
- Do you know memoization? How would you implement it in React?
- What is the difference between `useMemo` and `useCallback`?
- Do you know what is a Higher Order Component (HOC)? How would you implement it?


* Advanced
- To assess the performance of a React application: What would you do? What tools would you use? What metrics would you look at?
- What debugging tools do you use? How would you debug an unknown codebase?


### TypeScript
- What is TypeScript? Why would you use it?
- What is the difference between `interface` and `type`?
- What's a generic type? How would you use it?
- Explain what's the type inference in TypeScript.

### Javascript
- What's a closure? How would you use it?
- What does mutation mean? 
- What's a pure function? How would you implement it and why?
* It always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in. It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a programâ€™s execution. It must only depend on its input arguments. It cannot produce any side effect. It easy to test and debug.
* Make the candidate explain the difference between mutation and reassignment. (Hint: use `const` with `Array.push` and `let` to explain the difference)
- What's the difference between `==` and `===`?
